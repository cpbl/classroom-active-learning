The grades can also be used as participation/attendance marks.\r\nI also generate random groups for various group activities, which I've also used in a large class.\r\n\r\n### Main features\r\n - randomly assign (display) groups (by group size or by number of groups) for group-work sessions\r\n - randomly select one student\r\n - record oral response grade for most recently selected student\r\n - mark most recently selected student as absent for the rest of the session\r\n \r\nAlso includes tools for managing the in-class grade logs\r\n\r\n### Also now includes some non-active-learning tools\r\n - Includes a tool for distributing a PDF document individually to students, with each copy watermarked with the student's name in order to discourage redistribution.\r\n - Includes a processor to flexibly create multiple versions of a  LaTeX exam file, in which the multiple choice questions are randomly ordered.\r\n",
