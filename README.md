classroom-active-learning
=========================

Simple tools for implementing "active learning techniques" in (university) classrooms, based on having access to a list of student names.

Also now includes some non-active-learning tools:
Includes a tool for distributing a PDF document individually to students, with each copy watermarked with the student's name in order to discourage redistribution.
Includes a processor to flexibly create multiple versions of a  LaTeX exam file, in which the multiple choice questions are randomly ordered.
