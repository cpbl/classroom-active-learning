Classroom Active Learning utilities
=========================

Tools for implementing "active learning techniques" in (university) classrooms, 
based on having access to the class enrolment list.
Uses desktop environment pop-up notifications / windows.
To set up the interface, define hotkeys in your OS to call certain core routines.

In a small discussion based class, I give students the opportunity to discuss a question or homework problem with a peer or small group, knowing that they may, afterwards, be called on randomly by me to give a (graded) oral response. The grades can also be used as participation/attendance marks.
I also generate random groups for various group activities, which I've also used in a large class.

You can:
 - randomly assign (display) groups (by group size or by number of groups) for group-work sessions
 - randomly select one student
 - record oral response grade for most recently selected student
 - mark most recently selected student as absent for the rest of the session
 
Also includes tools for managing the in-class grade logs

Also now includes some non-active-learning tools:
 - Includes a tool for distributing a PDF document individually to students, with each copy watermarked with the student's name in order to discourage redistribution.
 - Includes a processor to flexibly create multiple versions of a  LaTeX exam file, in which the multiple choice questions are randomly ordered.
